This is a modern [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Features

- The new NextJS experimental [app directory](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13#new-app-directory-beta)
- Typescript 4.9.4 with strict type checks
- The bleeding edge [Yarn 4](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry) for package management with out-of-the box support for [Zero Installs](https://yarnpkg.com/features/zero-installs)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for linting) by default
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling
- Configuration files so that everything plays nicely with `nvim` and [coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
